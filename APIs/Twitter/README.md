* I pulled twitteroauth from this fork: https://github.com/jkbockstael/twitteroauth.  There didn't appear to be any great libraries for Twitter and PHP.  This was my runner up: https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth.  I went with twitteroauth cause it was the most popular.
* These classes assume that you are implementing them in Laravel and you have your Twitter credentials in a config file called "twitter"
